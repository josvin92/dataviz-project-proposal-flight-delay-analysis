# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is [Flight Delay Analysis Dataset](https://gist.github.com/josvin92/9a6b89cb9365b1042d6648fc584c3198)

## Prototypes

I’ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. It's a ... and it shows ...
This chart meant to show the "Average Delay Time and Delay Reason for various airline carriers". The color denotes the delay reason. The Delay Reason and the Avg Delay Time for each airline are shown on the tooltip as well when you hover over it.

(please put a screenshot of one or more visualizations of this dataset you already made, for previous assignments)

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * Which Aircraft Carrier has the highest average departure delay?
 * Which Aircraft Carrier has the lowest average departure delay? 
 * For the B6 Carrier, what was the major cause of delay? 
 * Which type of Delay caused the Max Avg Departure Delay?How much was the delay and for which aircraft was it? 
 * For each Aircraft Carrier, what are the delays they can reduce so as to increase on-time performance?
 * The concentration of delay and non-delay both on departure and on arrival?
 * The proportion of delayed flights that were diverted?
 * Are delays due to day_of_week and day_of_month?
 * The concentration of delays by 'Departure_Delay'?
 * Which airport in Origin stands out in delays?
 * Which airport in Destination stands out in delays?
 
 
## Sketches

(insert one or more hand-drawn sketches of interactive visualizations that you imagine)
(describe each sketch - how is the data visualized, what are the interactions, and how do these relate to the questions/tasks)

## Open Questions

(describe any fear, uncertainty, or doubt you’re having about the feasibility of implementing the sketched system. For example, “I’m not sure where to get the geographic shapes to build a map from this data” or “I don’t know how to resolve the codes to meaningful names” … Feel free to delete this section if you’re confident.)
